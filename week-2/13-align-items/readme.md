# Align Items

With flexbox, the `align-items` property can be used to control how the items are positioned inside of the container. In this exercise, you'll apply a different `align-items` property to each list. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. Look at the First list of countries. Then look at the solution displayed to the side. Find the differences between the two lists.
2. Use `align-items` and `flex-direction` to make the list of countries on the left look like the ones on the right.

_Hint: You can review how `align-items` works in [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#article-header-id-7)._
