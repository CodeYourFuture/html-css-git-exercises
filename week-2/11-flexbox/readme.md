# Flexbox

Flexbox is used to change the layout of elements on the HTML page. In this exercise, you'll apply the `flex-direction` property to change how the countries are displayed. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. Open `flexbox.css` and write a CSS rule to apply `display: flex` to the "container" element. _Hint: The "container" element will be the parent element of each country._
2. Look at the First list of countries. Then look at the solution displayed to the side. Find the differences between the two lists.
3. Use the property `flex-direction` to make the countries on the left look like the ones on the right.

_Hint: The images below describe how `flex-direction` works. Try to imagine `flex-direction` as the direction of the arrow._
