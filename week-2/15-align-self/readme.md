# Align self

With `align-items` you move all the items at once (on the **non-main axis**).
With `align-self` you move only one of the items.

In this exercise, you will use `align-self` and `align-items` to change the position of the items. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise:

1. Look at the First list of countries. Then look at the solution displayed to the side. Find the differences between the two lists.
2. Use `align-self` and `align-items` to make the list of countries on the left look like the ones on the right.

You can use the same values for `align-self` as you used for `align-items`.
