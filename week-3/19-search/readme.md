# Search Form

Forms are used everywhere on the web. One of the simplest forms you will find is a search form. In this exercise, you will create a form to search on Google. Follow the steps below to create your form.

1. Edit the `index.html` file. Find the line that says `<p>Delete this line and add your form.</p>`. Delete it.
2. Add a `<form>` to the same line where you deleted the text. The `<form>` should have two attributes: a `method` attribute that is `GET` and an `action` attribute that is `https://www.google.com/search`.
3. Inside of the `<form>` create an `<input>` field. The `type` attribute should be `text` and the `name` attribute should be `q`.

If you've done this correctly, you should be able to type into the field and hit `ENTER` and it will show you Google search results!
