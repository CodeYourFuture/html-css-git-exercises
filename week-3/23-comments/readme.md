# Blog Comments

The `<textarea>` is used for text that takes up more than one line. In this exercise, you'll add a form with a `<textarea>` for someone to leave their comment. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. Find the line that says `<!-- Your comment form goes here -->` in this exercise's `index.html` file.
2. Add a `<form>` with a `GET` method. _You do not need to add an `action` attribute to this form._
3. Add a `<textarea>` field that is named `comment`.
4. Don't forget to add a `<label>` so that users know what the field is for.
5. Add a `<button>` that says "Send Comment".

When you're done, it should look like this.
