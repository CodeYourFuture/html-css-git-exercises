# Checkout Form

This customer is ready to buy a CodeYourFuture t-shirt. We need to ask them who they are and how we can contact them so that we can send them the t-shirt.

In this exercise you will add forms to collect checkout information. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. Open `index.html` and find the line that says `<!-- Add the form fields here -->`.
2. Add an `<input>` field for the customer's name below this line. It should be a `text` field with a `name` attribute set to `customer-name`.
3. Add an `<input>` field for the customer's email address. It should be an `email` field with a `name` attribute set to `customer-email`.
4. Add an `<input>` field for the customer's phone number. It should be a `tel` field with a `name` attribute set to `customer-phone`.
5. Did you remember to add a `<label>` for each one of your fields? If not, go back now and give each field a label, taking care to link each field to its label by using the `for` and `id` attributes.
6. (Optional) Make the form easier to read by using `<p>` or `<div>` tags to add space between each field.

When you're done, it should look like this.
