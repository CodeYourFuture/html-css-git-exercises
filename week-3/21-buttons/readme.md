# Form Buttons

Forms can be submitted by hitting the `Enter` key. But not everyone knows this. Users expect to see a submit button, so you should make the search form more user-friendly.

In this exercise, you will add a submit button to the search form. Follow the steps below to add the button.

1. Add a `<button>` below the `<input>` field. The `<button>` should have a `type` attribute that is set to `submit`.
2. In the `<button>` element, add the text `Search`.

If you have done this correctly, you should see a "Search" button at the bottom of the form. When you click the button, it should complete the search on Google.
