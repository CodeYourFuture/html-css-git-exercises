# CSS Box Model

In this exercise, you will modify the "box model" with the CSS properties `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding` and `border`. Search on Google to learn how these properties work, then complete the steps below.

1. Open `styles.css` and find the `.pages__page` rule. Play around with the CSS properties in this rule to see how they work.
2. Right now, the countries are too close to each other. Use the box model properties you have learned so that the name of the country has white space around it on all sides.

When you have finished, the countries should look like the image below.

_Try this: Add `* { border: 1px solid red; }` to your CSS code. It will show you the box model of every element._
