# CSS Properties

There are many CSS properties you can use to change how your website looks. Add rules to the `styles.css` file to complete the steps below. _Do not edit the `index.html` file._

1. Make the links in the messages red and bold, and remove the underline.
2. Increase the font size of the message times to `0.9rem`.
3. Put a blue border on the left side of the last message to show it is unread.
4. Make yesterday's message partially transparent to show it is old.
5. Increase the space between each line in a message.

_Hint: You can use Google to learn new CSS properties. Try searching for color, font-weight, text-decoration, font-size, border, opacity, and line-height._
