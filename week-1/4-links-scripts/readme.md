# Adding Links and Scripts

This site is missing the CSS styles. It's also missing JavaScript code that will convert the URLs ("http://") into links that can be clicked.

Your colleagues have already written the .css and .js files. Complete the following steps to get this site working:

1. Add a `<link>` element that includes the `missing-styles.css` file in this exercise's directory. This should be placed in the `<head>` element.
2. Add a `<script>` element that includes the `convertUrls.js` file in this exercise's directory. This should be placed right before the end of the `<body>` element.
3. When you are finished, use git to add, commit and push your changes.

_Hint: When you are done, the messages should have the colours and layout like other exercises, and you should be able to click on the URLs ("http://") to go to them._
