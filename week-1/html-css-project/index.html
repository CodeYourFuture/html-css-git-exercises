          <p>A puzzle is a game, problem, or toy that tests a person's ingenuity or knowledge. 
            In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together in a logical way, 
            in order to arrive at the correct or fun solution of the puzzle.
             There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, 
             relational puzzles, or logic puzzles.</p>

          <p> Puzzles are often created to be a form of entertainment but they can also arise from serious mathematical 
            or logistical problems. In such cases, their solution may be a significant contribution to mathematical research</p>

          <h1 class="content_header">Bicycle</h1>
          <p> A bicycle, also called a cycle or bike, is a human-powered or motor-powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other.
            A bicycle rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.</p>

            <p> Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time.
              These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.
              They are the principal means of transportation in many regions.</p>

              <p> They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, military and police applications,
                courier services, bicycle racing and bicycle stunts.  </p>

          <p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically
             via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. 
            These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.</p>
